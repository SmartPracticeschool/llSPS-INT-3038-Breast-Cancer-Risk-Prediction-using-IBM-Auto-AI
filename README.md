Breast cancer represents one of the diseases that make a high number of deaths every
year. It is the most common type of all cancers and the main cause of women's deaths
worldwide. and the second highest in terms of mortality rates.Diagnosis of breast
cancer is performed when an abnormal lump is found (from self-examination or x-ray)
or a tiny speck of calcium is seen (on an x-ray). After a suspicious lump is found, the
doctor will conduct a diagnosis to determine whether it is cancerous and, if so, whether
it has spread to other parts of the body.
The purpose of this project is to predict a breast cancer in the body. and analysing the
breast cancer.
Finding solutions for breast cancer the growing world population has become a hot
topic for health organizations, entrepreneurs and philanthropists. These solutions
range from changing the way we go fast in our health orgnisations to remove the
breask cancer. To make. Hence, it is necessary that we analyse the breast cancer
risk and act faster rather than repenting later
The main aim of this project is to create an appropriate machine learning model to
analyse and predict the breast cancer in a body, So for that we will build a Machine
Learning model to predict the breast cancer in body using IBM Watson, AutoAI Machine
Learning Service. The model is deployed on IBM cloud to get scoring end point which
will
be used as API in mobile apps or web app building. We will develop a web application
using node red service. We will use the scoring end point to give user input values to the
deployed model.
The model prediction will be showcased on User Interface.
These Dataset consists of prediction of breast cancer in world. This was recorded for
people in the world along with the population . These data gives an idea of the Breast
cancer Patient in the world . Requrements of this model depending
upon its demography and can be used to learn the requirement trends.
The model formed using auto AI services in IBM Watson studio can be used to predict
the Breast cancer in human body.it is based on populations.generally this type of
symptoms shown in Women. The Node RED app gives an User-Friendly interface to
input the input the value and get prediction
 With the help of this UI, Efficient prediction of blood cancer that can be done in a
easy way.
 The prediction gives good insights about the risk of blood cancer in the body.
 Future planning can be done to reduce the bood cancer patients.
 The model may need to be re-trained in case of decrementation of patients.
 Many times we do face a situation where we find an imbalance in data which leads to
poor accuracy of models1. The model may need to be re-trained in case of decrementation of patients.
This solution can be used by health departments to reduce the blood cancer patients
in the world.and analysing the data of the blood cancer patients.
The model is deployed successfully and was used to build a web UI using Node RED
services.The model gave satisfactory results and the Web UI is working properly.
The solution can be improved for more heurestic analysis and can be further extended
to predict more detailed requirements in future.these model will be more helpfull to
predict and analysing the breast cancer patients according to growing up of the
populations in the world.
